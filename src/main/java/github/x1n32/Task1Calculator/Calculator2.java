/**Try Making this class do some more things to the original calculator.
 * Such as the Quadratic Formula. Search online on BBC Bitesize if you don't know what it is.

     * Try using values a b c 
     * to create a method of using the quadratic formula.
     * The quadratic formula is used to solve a quadratic to find x: ax^2 + bx + c
     * The Equation: x = (-b +- square root(b^2 - 4ac))  / 2a
     * +- means plus or minus. x should have two answers.
     * Should return a positive x answer, and a negative x answer.
     * e.g. 2x^2 -5x - 6 
     *      Gives the answer: x = 3.860.... and x = -0.88....
