## Git
Git is a collaborative open-source version control system
This means a history of pushed changes make it easy to rollback/rollforward to easily make changes.
This also make it easy to work with others as you can share code to work on the same project
It makes use of branches, where you make 'alternate timelines' to test out code before pushing it to the main code.
Anyone can create repositories where it gets stored on GitHub to back-up code or to share!
You can use GitHub Pages to load md/html files - Go to Settings, On the left side-bar click 'pages', then on source section click the 'none' button and provide a branch. This will display that branches index.html page or ReadMe.md file as your webpage.
