## Welcome!
The aim of the project is to improve awareness of collaboration tools by teaching programming, showcasing unit testing and continuous integration.
- This repository has some programming tasks you can from more beginner level tasks to more harder ones in terms of concepts. 
- While attempting the tasks, you can save your work, and this can provide feedback on how you are doing. 
- You can edit these files in GitHub or in Gitpod to make notes or answer some questions. 
- There is an information page to help answer general questions as well.
- Feel free to work in pairs or in a group.

## Instructions
- FIRST, make sure this repository is your own (either cloned from [Classrooms](https://classroom.github.com/a/SN5PqZFQ ) or Forking it.

- Then set this repository as a webpage - go to settings, pages, on the none button click the main branch. The link it generates is yours.

Your web address would be https://x1n32-how-to-guide.github.io/coding-tasks-<team-name-here>/

- Now open your webpage, and open gitpod on another tab. 
- It is advised to keep both tabs open, as you can see feedback on what you have done.
