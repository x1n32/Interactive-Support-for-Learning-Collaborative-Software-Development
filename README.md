# Task-1-Calculator
Download or open the code, and go into the source folder. Open up the calculator.java in the main folder and run the code.

It's a basic java file that does some math operations on some numbers. 
Are there any errors? Add some code of your own!

Once you have a grasp on how the calulator.java works, have some fun adding new methods and changing some numbers.
Then go on calulator2.java, and try to program the Quadratic Formula ( x = -b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a)
I've made some separate functions to make it somewhat easier to program. 
If you don't know what the quadratic formula is, take a look online, such as bbc bitesize.
Look at the test file for this one when you are done.
If you are struggling or want to check your answer, switch Branches and go to the 'Answers' branch.
 - if it doesn't run, try copying the code over to the main
