## Welcome!
The aim of the project is to improve awareness of collaboration tools by teaching programming, showcasing unit testing and continuous integration.
- This repository has some programming tasks you can from more beginner level tasks to more harder ones in terms of concepts. 
- While attempting the tasks, you can save your work, and this can provide feedback on how you are doing. 
- You can edit these files in GitHub or in Gitpod to make notes or answer some questions. 
- There is an information page to help answer general questions as well.
- Feel free to work in pairs or in a group.
