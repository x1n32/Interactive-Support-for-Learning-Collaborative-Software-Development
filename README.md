## Welcome!
The aim of the project is to improve awareness of collaboration tools by teaching programming, showcasing unit testing and continuous integration.
- There are three pages to look at: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3.
- Each page has some starter activies such as keyword match-up and code prediction.
- Then there are the coding tasks. 
- While attempting the tasks, you can save your work, and this can provide feedback on how you are doing. 
- In each page there is an status section to show how you are doing. It has a link to see any errors/ unattempted tasks and passed tasks


## Instructions
