- [x] 1. Fix squareOfB so that it returns the square value of input B (A number multiplied by itself e.g. num1 * num1)
- [x]  2. Fix fourAC so that it returns the value of 4 x input a x input c (multiply in code uses the * key.)
- [x] 3. Fix squareRootAnswer so that it returns the square root of (square of B - 4AC) (hint: Math.sqrt(X))
- [x]  4. There are two answers to the quadratic formula. The +- on the image use either of them.
- [ ]  5. Fix positive answer method/function by looking at the image above using +
- [ ]  6. Now do the same for the negative answer but using - instead of +
- [ ]  7. Using all the functions you have created, put it all into the final function
